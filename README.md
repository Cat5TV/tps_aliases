# tps_aliases
Minetest Mod to alias some nodes on TPS Servers.

# Config Options

Remove all Technic nodes (turn them into air) - this is good if you have removed Technic but some machines exist on your map. Do keep in mind though that it is very destructive (literally turns all technic nodes into air) so make sure you have a current backup before enabling this:

tps_aliases_purge_technic = true
